Spam mail prediction
Description:
Developed a **Spam Mail Prediction** model using **Logistic Regression**,achieving **96.6% accuracy** on test data and **96.7% accuracy** on training data.
Processed a dataset with **5,572 rows and 2 columns** from a CSV file.
Utilized **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data handling, while **sklearn.feature_extraction.text** was used to transform text data into feature vectors.
Implemented **train-test split** with **sklearn.model_selection** and evaluated performance using **sklearn.metrics**.
This project demonstrates expertise in **machine learning**, **text processing**, and **classification models**, optimizing accuracy for spam detection.
